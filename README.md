# Chess with a Twist
## Directions and Features
Just run the html file to play the game. It plays like a 2 player chess game shared on a single computer. There is currently no way to check, en Passant, or castle. The way to complete the game is to capture the king. This was on purpose as this was the way I personally played it as a child. It makes the game more interesting when you can snipe the king without any warning.
